<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	
	<p>Time complexity refers to how the runtime of an algorithm grows with the input size. A lower time complexity makes an algorithm more efficient.</p>
	
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. For example, an algorithm may require O(n) extra memory.</p>
